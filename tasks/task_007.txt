# Task ID: 7
# Title: HTTPS Server Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement embedded HTTPS server in the smartphone app to receive video clips from the IoT device over the Local Only Hotspot connection.
# Details:
1. Jetty Server Setup:
   - Implement embedded Jetty HTTPS server on port 8443
   - Configure TLSv1.3 with custom certificate
   - Set up server to start automatically when hotspot is active
   - Implement proper resource cleanup on server shutdown

2. API Endpoints:
   - Create POST /clips endpoint for video upload:
     * Accept multipart/form-data with event_id, file, metadata
     * Validate JWT in Authorization header
     * Return 201 Created with event_id on success
   - Implement GET /status endpoint for server status check
   - Add error handling and appropriate HTTP status codes

3. File Reception:
   - Implement chunked file reception (512KB chunks)
   - Add progress tracking and transfer rate calculation
   - Create adaptive rate control based on network conditions
   - Implement partial upload resumption capability

# Test Strategy:
1. Test server startup and shutdown
2. Verify TLS configuration and certificate validation
3. Test file upload with various file sizes
4. Measure transfer performance (target: >15MB/s)
5. Verify JWT validation and authorization
6. Test error handling and recovery
7. Validate chunked upload and resumption capability
