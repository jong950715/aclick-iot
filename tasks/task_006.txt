# Task ID: 6
# Title: Video Clip Extraction and Processing
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement functionality to extract 30-second video clips from the RingBuffer when triggered by button press, maintaining original quality.
# Details:
1. Clip Extraction:
   - Implement MediaMuxer for MP4 container creation
   - Create clip extraction logic to capture 15 seconds before and 15 seconds after button press
   - Ensure keyframe boundary alignment for clean extraction
   - Maintain original video quality without re-encoding

2. Metadata Embedding:
   - Add XMP metadata to MP4 files:
     * event_id: UUID String (RFC 4122 v4)
     * created_at: DateTime in ISO 8601 format
     * location data (when available)
     * resolution, fps, and duration
   - Calculate SHA-256 hash for file integrity verification

3. Temporary Storage:
   - Save extracted clips to getExternalFilesDir(null)
   - Implement cleanup mechanism for temporary files
   - Add error handling for storage space limitations

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify clip extraction timing accuracy
2. Test extraction with various video resolutions
3. Validate metadata embedding and retrieval
4. Measure extraction performance (target: <3 seconds)
5. Verify video quality preservation
6. Test handling of edge cases (buffer underrun, storage full)
7. Validate SHA-256 hash generation and verification
