# Task ID: 4
# Title: Security Protocol and Certificate Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RSA key exchange, TLS certificate infrastructure, and secure communication protocols between smartphone and IoT device.
# Details:
1. Certificate Infrastructure:
   - Create tools/gen_keys.sh script using OpenSSL for:
     * Root CA generation (RSA-4096 + SHA-256, 10-year validity)
     * Device certificate generation (RSA-2048, 1-year validity)
   - Implement certificate storage:
     * Android KeyStore API for secure key storage
     * Encrypted SharedPreferences for Flutter access

2. Key Exchange Protocol:
   - Implement RSA-2048 key pair generation
   - Create secure key exchange during initial pairing
   - Use OAEP padding with SHA-256 for encryption
   - Store exchanged keys securely in KeyStore

3. Secure Communication:
   - Implement JWT generation and validation:
     * HMAC SHA-256 signing
     * Payload with event_id, iat (issued at), exp (expiration)
   - Create SSID/password encryption using RSA
   - Implement TLSv1.3 with ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 cipher suite
   - Add certificate pinning for HTTPS connections

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify certificate generation and validation
2. Test key exchange protocol security
3. Validate JWT generation and verification
4. Test encrypted SSID/password transmission
5. Verify TLS connection establishment
6. Perform security audit of key storage
7. Test certificate pinning effectiveness
