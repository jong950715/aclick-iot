# Task ID: 4
# Title: Security Protocol and Certificate Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement RSA key exchange, TLS certificate infrastructure, and secure communication protocols between smartphone and IoT device.
# Details:
1. Certificate Infrastructure:
   - Create tools/gen_keys.sh script using OpenSSL for:
     * Root CA generation (RSA-4096 + SHA-256, 10-year validity)
     * Device certificate generation (RSA-2048, 1-year validity)
   - Implement certificate storage:
     * Android KeyStore API for secure key storage
     * Encrypted SharedPreferences for Flutter access

2. Key Exchange Protocol:
   - Implement RSA-2048 key pair generation
   - Create secure key exchange during initial pairing
   - Use OAEP padding with SHA-256 for encryption
   - Store exchanged keys securely in KeyStore

3. Secure Communication:
   - Implement JWT generation and validation:
     * HMAC SHA-256 signing
     * Payload with event_id, iat (issued at), exp (expiration)
   - Create SSID/password encryption using RSA
   - Implement TLSv1.3 with ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384 cipher suite
   - Add certificate pinning for HTTPS connections

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify certificate generation and validation
2. Test key exchange protocol security
3. Validate JWT generation and verification
4. Test encrypted SSID/password transmission
5. Verify TLS connection establishment
6. Perform security audit of key storage
7. Test certificate pinning effectiveness

# Subtasks:
## 1. Certificate Generation Tools and Scripts [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop tools and scripts for generating, signing, and managing digital certificates for the security infrastructure
### Details:
Create command-line utilities and automation scripts to generate X.509 certificates, manage certificate authorities (CAs), handle certificate signing requests (CSRs), and implement certificate rotation mechanisms. Include documentation on usage and integration with the broader system.

## 2. Certificate Storage Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Design and implement secure storage mechanisms for certificates and private keys
### Details:
Develop a secure storage solution for certificates and private keys, including encryption at rest, access controls, and proper permission management. Implement APIs for secure retrieval and usage of certificates by authorized system components.

## 3. RSA Key Exchange Protocol [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Implement the RSA key exchange protocol for secure communication between system components
### Details:
Design and implement the RSA key exchange protocol, including key generation, exchange mechanisms, and validation. Ensure proper handling of key sizes, padding schemes, and integration with the certificate infrastructure. Include unit tests and security validation.

## 4. JWT Implementation for Authentication [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Develop JWT-based authentication system using the certificate infrastructure
### Details:
Implement JSON Web Token (JWT) authentication using RSA signatures from the certificate infrastructure. Include token issuance, validation, refresh mechanisms, and revocation capabilities. Ensure proper claims handling and security best practices for JWT implementation.

## 5. TLS Configuration and Certificate Pinning [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Configure TLS settings and implement certificate pinning for secure communications
### Details:
Set up TLS configurations with appropriate cipher suites, protocol versions, and security parameters. Implement certificate pinning to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. Create documentation for deployment and maintenance of the TLS infrastructure, including procedures for certificate updates and pinning changes.
