# Task ID: 9
# Title: Button Interface Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement integration with physical button (initially mocked) for triggering video clip capture and transfer process.
# Details:
1. Button Interface Mocking:
   - Create software button in IoT app UI for initial testing
   - Implement BLE service simulation with UUID: 0000FFE0-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
   - Add characteristic with UUID: 0000FFE1-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
   - Simulate button press with 0x01 value

2. Button Event Processing:
   - Create ButtonEventHandler to process button press events
   - Implement debouncing logic to prevent duplicate events
   - Add event creation and propagation to event management system
   - Create workflow orchestration:
     * Button press → Event creation → Clip extraction → Transfer initiation

3. Future Hardware Integration:
   - Design abstract interface for hardware button integration
   - Document nRF52840 GPIO configuration for future implementation:
     * P0.13: Input pin with internal pullup and edge detection
     * P0.14: LED status indicator
   - Prepare for BLE and GPIO integration

# Test Strategy:
1. Test button press detection and debouncing
2. Verify event creation and propagation
3. Test end-to-end workflow from button press to transfer
4. Measure response time from button press to clip extraction
5. Validate multiple rapid button presses handling
6. Test mocked BLE service functionality
