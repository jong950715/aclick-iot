# Task ID: 9
# Title: Button Interface Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement integration with physical button (initially mocked) for triggering video clip capture and transfer process.
# Details:
1. Button Interface Mocking:
   - Create software button in IoT app UI for initial testing
   - Implement BLE service simulation with UUID: 0000FFE0-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
   - Add characteristic with UUID: 0000FFE1-0000-1000-8000-00805F9B34FB
   - Simulate button press with 0x01 value

2. Button Event Processing:
   - Create ButtonEventHandler to process button press events
   - Implement debouncing logic to prevent duplicate events
   - Add event creation and propagation to event management system
   - Create workflow orchestration:
     * Button press → Event creation → Clip extraction → Transfer initiation

3. Future Hardware Integration:
   - Design abstract interface for hardware button integration
   - Document nRF52840 GPIO configuration for future implementation:
     * P0.13: Input pin with internal pullup and edge detection
     * P0.14: LED status indicator
   - Prepare for BLE and GPIO integration

# Test Strategy:
1. Test button press detection and debouncing
2. Verify event creation and propagation
3. Test end-to-end workflow from button press to transfer
4. Measure response time from button press to clip extraction
5. Validate multiple rapid button presses handling
6. Test mocked BLE service functionality

# Subtasks:
## 1. Button Interface Mocking [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a software UI mockup and BLE service simulation for button interface testing
### Details:
Develop a software-based UI that simulates physical buttons. Implement a mock BLE service that mimics the behavior of hardware buttons. Include visual feedback for button presses and ensure the mock interface can generate the same events that would come from physical hardware.

## 2. Button Event Processing Implementation [done]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement button event handling with debouncing and event propagation mechanisms
### Details:
Create an event handling system that processes button press events. Implement debouncing logic to prevent multiple triggers from a single press. Develop an event propagation system that routes button events to the appropriate application components. Include support for different types of button interactions (short press, long press, double press).

## 3. Hardware Integration Preparation [done]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Prepare the codebase for future integration with physical button hardware
### Details:
Design and document the hardware abstraction layer that will interface with physical buttons in the future. Create adapter interfaces that will allow for seamless transition from software simulation to hardware implementation. Develop a testing framework to validate button functionality with both simulated and real hardware inputs.
