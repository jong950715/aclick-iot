# Task ID: 3
# Title: Local Only Hotspot Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Local Only Hotspot functionality in the smartphone app and Wi-Fi client connection in the IoT app for high-speed data transfer.
# Details:
1. Smartphone App (Receiver):
   - Implement WifiManager.LocalOnlyHotspotReservation
   - Create HotspotManager class to handle:
     * Hotspot creation and teardown
     * SSID/Password generation and management
     * Connection state monitoring
   - Add permission handling for ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
   - Implement automatic hotspot activation on event notification

2. IoT App (Transmitter):
   - Create WifiNetworkSpecifier using WifiNetworkSpecifier.Builder
   - Implement NetworkRequest for connecting to hotspot
   - Add connection state monitoring and timeout handling
   - Implement automatic Wi-Fi connection when SSID/password received

3. Integration:
   - Use Bluetooth Classic to transmit encrypted SSID/password
   - Implement connection verification and fallback mechanisms
   - Add network quality monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Test hotspot creation success rate on various Android devices
2. Measure connection establishment time (target: 3-5 seconds)
3. Verify connection stability under different conditions
4. Test automatic reconnection after signal loss
5. Measure data transfer speeds (target: ~22 MB/s)
6. Verify proper cleanup of hotspot resources after use
