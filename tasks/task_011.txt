# Task ID: 11
# Title: Task #11: Implement Bluetooth Classic Independent Package
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a standalone Bluetooth Classic package that provides Bluetooth functionality for Flutter applications, initially supporting Android with architecture prepared for future iOS implementation, and publish it to pub.dev.
# Details:
The implementation should focus on creating a well-structured, maintainable Bluetooth Classic package with the following components:

1. Platform-independent API layer:
   - Create abstract interfaces that define all Bluetooth operations
   - Implement a plugin registration mechanism
   - Design a clean, intuitive API for developers
   - Include proper error handling and status reporting

2. Android implementation:
   - Utilize Android's BluetoothAdapter, BluetoothDevice, and BluetoothSocket classes
   - Implement device discovery functionality
   - Support pairing/unpairing operations
   - Enable data transmission (both synchronous and asynchronous)
   - Handle Bluetooth permissions properly
   - Support multiple connection management

3. iOS implementation structure:
   - Create placeholder classes for iOS implementation
   - Document the expected implementation approach
   - Ensure the architecture allows for seamless iOS integration later

4. Comprehensive documentation:
   - Write detailed API documentation with examples
   - Include installation and setup instructions
   - Document platform-specific considerations
   - Provide troubleshooting guides

5. Example application:
   - Create a demo app showcasing all package features
   - Include device discovery, connection, and data transfer examples
   - Demonstrate proper lifecycle management
   - Show best practices for error handling

6. Testing structure:
   - Implement unit tests for the API layer
   - Create integration tests for Android implementation
   - Set up mocking framework for testing without actual devices
   - Document test coverage requirements

The package should support customization through configuration options for connection timeouts, buffer sizes, and retry policies. It should also provide both synchronous and asynchronous APIs where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
Testing will be conducted in multiple phases to ensure the package functions correctly:

1. Unit Testing:
   - Test all public API methods with mocked platform implementations
   - Verify proper error propagation and handling
   - Test configuration options and their effects
   - Ensure API consistency across platforms

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test Android implementation with actual Bluetooth devices
   - Create a test matrix covering different Android versions (minimum API 21)
   - Test various Bluetooth operations: discovery, connection, data transfer
   - Verify proper resource cleanup and lifecycle management
   - Test performance with different data sizes and transfer rates

3. Example App Verification:
   - Manually test the example app on multiple Android devices
   - Verify all features work as documented
   - Test edge cases like connection loss, permission denial
   - Validate behavior when Bluetooth is disabled/enabled during operation

4. Documentation Testing:
   - Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness
   - Verify code examples work as described
   - Have a developer unfamiliar with the package follow the documentation to implement basic features

5. Package Publishing Verification:
   - Validate the package against pub.dev requirements
   - Test installation in a clean Flutter project
   - Verify proper platform detection and implementation selection
   - Check for any native dependencies that might cause issues

6. Continuous Integration:
   - Set up CI pipeline to run tests automatically
   - Include linting and static analysis
   - Verify package works with the latest Flutter versions

Success criteria include passing all tests, proper documentation coverage, and successful publication to pub.dev with a minimum score of 90 points.
