Integration Testing:\n   - Test Android implementation with actual Bluetooth devices\n   - Create a test matrix covering different Android versions (minimum API 21)\n   - Test various Bluetooth operations: discovery, connection, data transfer\n   - Verify proper resource cleanup and lifecycle management\n   - Test performance with different data sizes and transfer rates\n\n3. Example App Verification:\n   - Manually test the example app on multiple Android devices\n   - Verify all features work as documented\n   - Test edge cases like connection loss, permission denial\n   - Validate behavior when Bluetooth is disabled/enabled during operation\n\n4. Documentation Testing:\n   - Review all documentation for accuracy and completeness\n   - Verify code examples work as described\n   - Have a developer unfamiliar with the package follow the documentation to implement basic features\n\n5. Package Publishing Verification:\n   - Validate the package against pub.dev requirements\n   - Test installation in a clean Flutter project\n   - Verify proper platform detection and implementation selection\n   - Check for any native dependencies that might cause issues\n\n6. Continuous Integration:\n   - Set up CI pipeline to run tests automatically\n   - Include linting and static analysis\n   - Verify package works with the latest Flutter versions\n\nSuccess criteria include passing all tests, proper documentation coverage, and successful publication to pub.dev with a minimum score of 90 points.",
