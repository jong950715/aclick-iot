# Task ID: 1
# Title: Project Setup and Environment Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the mono-repo structure with Flutter projects for both smartphone and IoT apps, including shared core packages and CI/CD pipeline.
# Details:
1. Create Git mono-repo with structure:
   - /apps/phone (Flutter Android app)
   - /apps/iot (Flutter Android app for IoT mocking)
   - /packages/core (shared modules)
2. Configure Flutter 3.29.3 environment for both apps
3. Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline with:
   - Lint and static analysis
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Build automation
4. Create shared Riverpod state management structure
5. Configure code conventions and PR workflow documentation
6. Initialize shared packages for:
   - Event models (Protobuf definitions)
   - Encryption utilities
   - Network protocols
7. Set up dependency injection and module structure

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify correct repository structure and branch protection rules
2. Validate CI/CD pipeline with test commits
3. Ensure Flutter environment consistency across both apps
4. Test shared package imports and accessibility
5. Verify Riverpod provider setup and state management

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Mono-repo Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up the base repository structure with appropriate folders for Flutter apps and shared packages
### Details:
Create the base mono-repo structure with the following organization:
- /apps/phone (Flutter Android app)
- /apps/iot (Flutter Android app for IoT mocking)
- /packages/core (shared modules)
Initialize git repository, set up .gitignore files, and document the repository structure in README.md.

## 2. Configure Flutter Environment [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and standardize Flutter 3.29.3 development environment for both applications
### Details:
Create pubspec.yaml files for both Flutter applications with consistent dependencies. Configure Flutter 3.29.3 environment settings and developer tools. Set up shared linting rules and code formatting standards. Create project-specific environment configurations (dev, staging, production) for both apps.

## 3. Implement CI/CD Pipeline [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Set up GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration and deployment
### Details:
Create GitHub Actions workflow files for:
- Lint and static code analysis
- Unit and integration tests
- Automated builds for different environments
Configure branch protection rules that require passing tests before merging. Set up automated deployment processes for development and staging environments.

## 4. Set Up Shared Package Framework [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Create the structure for shared packages that will be used by both applications
### Details:
Create the basic structure for shared packages in the /packages/core directory, including:
- Event models with Protobuf definitions
- Encryption utilities
- Network protocol handlers
Configure package dependencies and exports. Set up versioning strategy for shared packages.

## 5. Implement State Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Set up Riverpod state management structure for both applications
### Details:
Configure Riverpod for state management across both applications:
- Set up provider structure and organization
- Implement state containers and controllers
- Create sample implementations demonstrating usage patterns
- Document state management architecture and best practices

## 6. Implement Dependency Injection [done]
### Dependencies: 1.5
### Description: Set up dependency injection framework for managing service instances
### Details:
Implement a dependency injection system that works with Riverpod:
- Create service locator pattern for common services
- Set up injection for network clients, repositories, and utilities
- Configure scoped providers for feature-specific dependencies
- Ensure testability through proper dependency management

## 7. Create Developer Documentation [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3, 1.6
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for project setup, architecture, and developer workflows
### Details:
Develop comprehensive project documentation including:
- Environment setup instructions
- Repository structure and conventions
