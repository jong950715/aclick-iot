# Task ID: 5
# Title: Camera RingBuffer Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement video RingBuffer system in the IoT app using CameraX API to continuously record and store the last 30 seconds of footage.
# Details:
1. Camera Setup:
   - Implement CameraX integration using SessionConfiguration.Builder
   - Configure VideoCapture and Preview components
   - Set up camera resolution selection based on device memory:
     * Use ActivityManager.getMemoryClass() to detect available memory
     * Default to 1080p, fallback to 720p on memory constraints

2. RingBuffer Implementation:
   - Create circular buffer for video frames using CameraX API
   - Configure H.264 encoding (Baseline Profile, Level 4.1)
   - Set variable bitrate: 4-8 Mbps for 1080p, 2-4 Mbps for 720p
   - Configure AAC-LC audio: 48kHz, stereo, 128kbps
   - Implement memory management with WeakReference caching

3. Memory Optimization:
   - Add real-time memory monitoring (Debug.getNativeHeapAllocatedSize())
   - Implement ByteBuffer object pooling for frame handling
   - Create OutOfMemoryError handler with recovery mechanism
   - Add automatic resolution adjustment based on memory pressure

# Test Strategy:
1. Test camera initialization on various devices
2. Verify RingBuffer functionality with different resolutions
3. Measure memory usage during continuous recording
4. Test recovery from memory pressure situations
5. Verify video quality and encoding parameters
6. Measure CPU usage during recording (target: <40%)
7. Test long-duration stability (24+ hours)

# Subtasks:
## 1. CameraX API Integration and Configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up and configure CameraX API to capture video frames for the ring buffer system
### Details:
Implement CameraX lifecycle integration, configure camera resolution and frame rate settings, set up the image analysis use case to process frames, handle camera permissions, and create a frame capture callback mechanism to feed into the ring buffer

## 2. Circular Buffer Implementation for Video Frames [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Design and implement a circular buffer data structure to store and manage video frames
### Details:
Create a thread-safe circular buffer implementation, develop frame storage and retrieval mechanisms, implement buffer overwrite logic for continuous recording, add timestamp tracking for frames, and create methods to extract frame sequences when needed

## 3. Memory Optimization and Monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Optimize memory usage and implement monitoring systems for the ring buffer
### Details:
Implement frame compression or downsampling techniques, create a memory usage monitoring system, develop adaptive buffer size based on available memory, implement frame recycling to reduce garbage collection, and add memory threshold alerts

## 4. Performance Testing and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Test and optimize the ring buffer implementation for performance and reliability
### Details:
Conduct frame rate and processing time benchmarks, test memory leak scenarios, optimize critical paths in the implementation, implement stress testing under various conditions, and document performance characteristics and limitations
