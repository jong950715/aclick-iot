# Task ID: 5
# Title: Camera RingBuffer Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement video RingBuffer system in the IoT app using CameraX API to continuously record and store the last 30 seconds of footage.
# Details:
1. Camera Setup:
   - Implement CameraX integration using SessionConfiguration.Builder
   - Configure VideoCapture and Preview components
   - Set up camera resolution selection based on device memory:
     * Use ActivityManager.getMemoryClass() to detect available memory
     * Default to 1080p, fallback to 720p on memory constraints

2. RingBuffer Implementation:
   - Create circular buffer for video frames using CameraX API
   - Configure H.264 encoding (Baseline Profile, Level 4.1)
   - Set variable bitrate: 4-8 Mbps for 1080p, 2-4 Mbps for 720p
   - Configure AAC-LC audio: 48kHz, stereo, 128kbps
   - Implement memory management with WeakReference caching

3. Memory Optimization:
   - Add real-time memory monitoring (Debug.getNativeHeapAllocatedSize())
   - Implement ByteBuffer object pooling for frame handling
   - Create OutOfMemoryError handler with recovery mechanism
   - Add automatic resolution adjustment based on memory pressure

# Test Strategy:
1. Test camera initialization on various devices
2. Verify RingBuffer functionality with different resolutions
3. Measure memory usage during continuous recording
4. Test recovery from memory pressure situations
5. Verify video quality and encoding parameters
6. Measure CPU usage during recording (target: <40%)
7. Test long-duration stability (24+ hours)
