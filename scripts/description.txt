Break down the Bluetooth Classic connection implementation into five key subtasks:

1)  Implementing Bluetooth adapter access and device discovery in the smartphone app,
2) Establishing a Bluetooth connection in the IoT application,
3) Defining a shared communication protocol and command format,
4) Managing connection states and transitions, and
5) Performing testing and applying stability improvements.
